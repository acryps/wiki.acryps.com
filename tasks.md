# Workflow
## Tasks
A task is a clearly scoped change that doesn't need further definitions, anything up to about **half a day of work**
Customers will see the names we use for the tasks.

While creating tasks for the future, add notes to keep track of the requirements.
If you end up writing a todo list within the nodes, just split it into multiple tasks!

Prefixes
- Add (new feature)
- Fix (fix issue, remove something)
- Document 
- Review
- Test
- Merge
- Meeting

Examples:
- Fix gallery image aspect ratio
- Review wiki changes

Workflow:
1. Define Tasks in timesheet (with project manager)
2. Create branch (if >1/2 day of work)
3. Implement changes
4. Create pull request (if branch was created)
5. Review code and add comments
6. Iterate step 3-5 until satisfied
7. Merge branch (by project manager)

## Work Items
Groups multiple connected tasks into a work item.

The work items are assigned by the project manager with the customer.
The work item will appear as a group of tasks on the customers bill.

Example:
- Add branding (Ringbaker)
- Add smaba connector (Sedion)
